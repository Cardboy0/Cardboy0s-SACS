1. Include option to do the whole preparing-of-your-objects-with-the-mdd-addon automatically instead of yourself. The reason that wasn't implemented from the start is mostly because often your original objects have properties conflicting with mdd but you would only notice that once the script is already done.
  1.1 Have the user only choose one object instead of the original + "softbody-dummy", differentiate between original and softbody relevant modifiers by having the later hidden when starting the script.

2. Enable "saving" of vertex groups for the next frames. 
  2.1 Add option to have the vertex group changes keyframed through the addon animall, to see how the vertexweights changed over each frame after the result is finished.

3. disable actual stretching of keyframes, just add the additional frame to the temporary copy of the current frame.

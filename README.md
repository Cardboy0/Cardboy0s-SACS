# Cardboy0s-SACS
Cardboy0's shapekey- and animation-compliant softbodies (for Blender)


This branch contains versions of my SACS script that are prior to the most current one. Useful if someone wants to work with an older version, for whatever reason.
If u want to access the most current version go to the master branch instead (https://github.com/Cardboy0/Cardboy0s-SACS/tree/master).

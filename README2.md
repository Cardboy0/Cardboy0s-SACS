# Cardboy0s-SACS
Cardboy0's shapekey- and animation-compliant softbodies (for Blender)

This branch contains versions that have a higher version than the current one in the master branch, but that in my opinion don't involve enough changes to replace the master-one already. Once enough changes happened over the course of a few versions, the latest one will replace the master-one.
